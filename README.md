Welcome to the "React YouTube Clone" project, a scalable and feature-rich YouTube clone built with React. This project replicates key functionalities of YouTube, including the home page, side bar, search results page, and video playback with a live chat feature. The application is designed for scalability and uses Redux to manage state, providing a seamless user experience.

## Project Highlights

- **Home Page**: Mimics the layout of YouTube's home page with recommended videos.
- **Side Bar**: Includes navigation links for easy access to different sections of the application.
- **Search Result Page**: Displays search results based on user queries with debouncing to reduce unnecessary API calls.
- **Watch Page**: Allows users to watch videos, view comments, and participate in live chat.
- **Live Chat**: Real-time chat functionality integrated into the watch page.
- **Nested Comments**: Supports nested comments for better organization and engagement.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Utilizes Redux for efficient state management, making the project highly scalable.
